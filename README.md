For the Programming Languages class, I chose to uplaod the AirdedBanking project. It was probaly  one of my favorite ones to work on because it felt like I was programming for a grocery store in real life. I was able to get the program to work, but struggled with the data to bring in because I had been using Eclipse all this time and now had to use Visio. My laptop did not have enought space, so I had to borrow someone else laptop and due to time contraints over looked the detail of reading and analyzing the input. I do realize that I could have commented more throrugh so as a Team I can share my code without questions. I coded a few lines then ran debug instead of writing 5 lines , it was literally 2 to 3 lines then test. The difficult part was making the header and following the functions parameters names so I didn't get mixed up. W3 School helped alot. Biggest thing is to write code in block and sections and 1 code calls the other but the main is just to call the functions to make it maintaiable.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? User needs is basically, having an applicaiton to solve a problem and User Stories is a good way to gather the data. I watched a video 1 time that showed how dominos had people come and test their pizza but they had to first know what they 
were building and then build upon that. For example, if we have a user that has a carwash business, what must first know what all they want the car wash to do
because not all car washes are the same.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? One approach to programming, is  to plan and plan on having more meetings to keep the communication going. Once that is established, then the building can happen. It would not be good to build a program and then have to re- start it because the communication wasn't right and someting got missed which resulted in an incomplete program.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? A good team member is helping each other wheter that me knowledge sharing or helping a coworked who may have fallen behind scheudled. Thus a good team member first understands, we are a team, not I am a team.

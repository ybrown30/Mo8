For the Programming Languages class, I chose to uplaod the AirdedBanking project. It was probaly  one of my favorite ones to work on because it felt like I was programming for a grocery store in real life. I was able to get the program to work, but struggled with the data to bring in because I had been using Eclipse all this time and now had to use Visio. My laptop did not have enought space, so I had to borrow someone else laptop and due to time contraints over looked the detail of reading and analyzing the input. I do realize that I could have commented more throrugh so as a Team I can share my code without questions. I coded a few lines then ran debug instead of writing 5 lines , it was literally 2 to 3 lines then test. The difficult part was making the header and following the functions parameters names so I didn't get mixed up. W3 School helped alot. Biggest thing is to write code in block and sections and 1 code calls the other but the main is just to call the functions to make it maintaiable.
